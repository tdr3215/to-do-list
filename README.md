# ToDo List App Project

This app was built using bootstrap, html, css, and javascript

##Features

```add and remove buttons
```text input for creating new task

##Accomplished

I was able to create the functions for loading the tasks,adding them, and saving them to the local storage window object.

## Future Plans

I still need to figure out how to delete the tasks as well as turn the inputs into list items for a unordered list
